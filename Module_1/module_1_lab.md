# Lab One: Initial Lab Setup

## Downloading and starting VMWare Fusion with Ubuntu 18 image

### Introduction: 
This isn't a lab as much as the setup for what **will** be our labs. The first rule of creating any application is to ensure that we are all on the same environment (in order to prevent the dreaded "IT WORKED FINE ON MY COMPUTER I SWEAR!" excuse)

### Step One: Downloading the necessary components
For this lab we'll be utilizing [vmware_fusion](https://www.vmware.com/uk/products/fusion.html) to host our environment. Our first step will be to [download](https://www.vmware.com/uk/products/fusion/fusion-evaluation.html) version 11 of vmware fusion (don't worry about using the **pro**...the plain one is fine.). 

### Step Two: Register and set up the master password and username
So there are a bunch of steps to go through here. Instead of going through and doing a bunch of screen shots I'll just leave it to you guys to fill everything out. _One note of warning_: keep the username and password simple. We will not be storing Nuclear codes on this server; this is simply going to be used for the exercises here. In other words: _password_ / _password_ is perfectly fine.

### Step Three: Getting the image
Obviously just having a virtual machine isn't enough; we also need an image to form our OS. For this project we will be using a linux distribution known as [ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/)- which is used all the time and works well with GoLang. Let's download the image for the ubuntu server [here](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server) ![ubuntu](./images/ubuntuimg.jpg)
